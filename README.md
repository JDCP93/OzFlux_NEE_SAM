# OzFlux_NEE_SAM

Repo to track modelling of Aussie ecosystems using SAM

## Models

All models, inputs, and outputs have a code in the filename to identify which
climate variables are involved out of the 5 below:

 - R: Shortwave Radiation
 - T: Air Temperature
 - P: Precipitation
 - V: Vapour Pressure Deficit
 - S: Soil Moisture Content

Therefore, a file called "Model_RTPV" is a model which uses the 4 climate drivers
specified by RTPV - it doesn't include soil moisture.

RTPVS is the analysis that Liu et al (2019) performed for other sites globally.
